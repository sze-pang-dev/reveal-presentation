- It provides all data in the same format from multiple data sources such as academic institutions, government to private companies <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> <br/><br/>
- Once subscribed to a data product, you can use the AWS Data Exchange API to load data directly into Amazon S3 and then analyze it <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> <br/><br/>
- For data providers, by migrating to the cloud it removes the need to build and maintain infrastructure for data storage, delivery, billing, and entitling  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> <br/><br/>
